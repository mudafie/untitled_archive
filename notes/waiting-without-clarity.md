title: On Waiting Without Clarity

This is a record, not an argument.

It had been building for a while. I can see that now. What started as idle questions eventually stopped staying in the background. They began pressing on things I had treated as settled.

If the Bible is written by many people, often in the name of others, where does its authority actually come from?

If Saul of Tarsus was a persecutor of the early church, why do we assume his letters were not an attempt to reshape or redirect Christ’s teaching? His conversion story is written decades later. His letters circulated early. He helped shape the narrative we inherited.

Was Jesus the Son of God, or a charismatic apocalyptic preacher whose message outlived him?

I didn’t arrive at answers. I mostly learned how thin some of my confidence was.

At the same time, everything else felt unstable. I was waiting on bar exam results. My wife was almost nine months pregnant. Pressure accumulated without any obvious outlet.

On the morning of April 25, 2025, I finally stopped trying to hold myself together. Not dramatically. Just a quiet collapse. I bowed my head. I made the sign of the cross. I asked, without much conviction, for enough grace to get through the day.

I wasn’t confident I had passed. I wasn’t asking for resolution. I just wanted to survive Friday.

The rest reads like a story now, which makes me suspicious of it. Results were released early. I passed. That afternoon we learned our daughter would be born that weekend. Two days later, she was.

Holding her, everything felt present in a way I hadn’t been able to force. God, pain, fear, gratitude. None of it resolved the questions. It didn’t answer them. It interrupted them.

I’m not sure what any of that proves.

I’m leaving this here because it’s where I was. I don’t know yet whether waiting is wisdom, avoidance, or obedience.
